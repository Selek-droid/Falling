# Falling
Falling logs - a game about falling shapes, to help me learn Game Maker Studio 2.

At this stage, blocks are falling correctly and stopping on the ground or each other.  Remaining issues:
1. Collision detection isn't always perfect.  Some blocks sometimes overlap others.
2. Haven't yet implemented horizontal boundaries
3. Need a game-lost condition to prevent pileup if player is losing.
4. Need to remove successful rows!
